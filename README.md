# hello-world
Hey peeps. How ya all doing?
My name is Fusion and I like computers and dogs(dogs>computers always).
I was never really interested in the tied up routine that my college made me follow so I used to start learning on my own, and I am still learning(we all are). Plus this is my first time here. Woot!
